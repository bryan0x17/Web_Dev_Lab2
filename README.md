Part A: Create a resume using HTML and CSS

Using the information from your current resume, create a web page titled ‘resume.html’ and control the formatting using CSS. Your page should incorporate the following:

•	Your contact information (name, address, etc) should be at the top and centred. 
•	Include a photo of yourself at the top of the page.
•	Important headings e.g. Work Experience must be of a larger font and written in bold letters.
•	Include a background colour or image on the webpage

The CSS directives can be in-line, listed the <head> of the page or an external CSS file.

Your CSS file will contain ‘@media all’ and ‘@media print’ tags. Within the @media-all tag will be the CSS code to display the content as web page you have designed. 

Within the @media print tag, the background and fonts should be changed to include:

o	No background images or colours
o	Reduced and/or a ‘sans-serif’ type font 


Part B: Vacation or recreation page

Find 6 pictures that you have taken while on vacation or any other experience. Copy these into the ‘photos’ sub-directory.

Using the <figure> and <figcaption> tags, arrange the photos on the page. The <figcaption> will include a title and explanation of the picture and be centred within the tag. Arrange the pictures that they are indented 20% from either left or right margin. Use a unique font style (e.g. Google Fonts) and include a background colour, pattern or image.

Use CSS to control the font, margins, photo size and location on the page.
